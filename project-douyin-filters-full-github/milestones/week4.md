中国数字文化与白瘦幼审美
中国数字文化最显著的特征之一，是白瘦幼——字面意为“白皙、纤瘦、年轻”——作为主导女性审美理想的巩固。这一网络热词凝练了三项相互关联的价值：白皙肤色、纤瘦体型与稚嫩容颜。尽管这些审美要素各自拥有悠久的文化渊源，但它们在数字媒体平台上被浓缩为单一符号并实现常态化传播，恰恰揭示了传统美学标准如何在算法媒体时代被重塑、强化并广泛传播。
1. 历史文化根源 对白皙（bai）的推崇深深植根于中国文化史，白皙肌肤长期象征着社会阶层差异、闲适生活与理想魅力。“一白遮百丑”的谚语正是这种持久关联的缩影。纤瘦（瘦）虽在历史语境中不如当代强调，却日益成为中国现代女性气质的标识，其形成既受全球时尚产业影响，也承载着本土健康理念与自律话语的塑造。青春感（尤指“少女感”这种童稚化审美）则折射出文化对纯真、脆弱与理想化女性气质的偏好。三者交织形成的“白瘦幼”美学，将这些理想浓缩为 
2. 数字媒体的放大效应 中国社交媒体平台，尤其是抖音和小红书，在放大并固化“白幼瘦”理想方面发挥着核心作用。在小红书平台上，生活方式与美妆博主频繁使用“变白秘籍”、“减肥打卡”等话题标签，将追求白皙与纤瘦塑造成日常实践。抖音爆红的“身材挑战”——如A4腰挑战、锁骨硬币挑战、iPhone腿挑战——将纤瘦视觉化游戏化，使身体合规性成为公开表演。研究表明，接触此类挑战与年轻女性用户身体不满感和外貌焦虑加剧存在关联（Hu et al., 2023）。此类实践揭示了算法驱动的潮流如何在“白瘦有”语境下催生自我监视与竞争文化。
3. 滤镜默认值与算法标准化 平台美颜滤镜的设计进一步固化了“白幼瘦”标准。默认滤镜普遍具备美白肤色、瘦脸、放大眼睛、平滑肤质等功能，塑造出同质化的“标准脸”。诸如“初恋脸”、“妈生皮”或“少女感”等滤镜名称，将技术效果与文化中纯真、纯洁和理想化的审美标准明确关联。这些效果默认应用（通常无需用户干预）的事实表明，白首有不仅是一种追求
4. 跨文化对比与本土化 尽管Instagram和Snapchat等全球平台同样推崇同质化的审美标准——通常符合以欧洲为中心的审美理想，如古铜色肌肤、立体颧骨和丰润双唇——但中国白手有审美却展现了算法美学的本土化表达。正如谢与张（2013）在跨文化研究中揭示的：中国广告极度推崇白皙肤色，而美国广告则倾向强调古铜色肌肤与健美体态。孟（2025）同样记录了海外中国女性如何在“白手游”审美与“卡戴珊式”曲线身材等西方理想间寻求平衡。这些对比揭示：尽管美颜滤镜在全球范围内规范着身体形态，其强加的具体审美标准却植根于特定文化语境与历史背景。
5. 社会后果与性别规训 “白幼瘦”的普及对性别认同与自我呈现产生深远影响。宋耿、林柏瀚等学者指出，中国消费文化中对女性身体的规训既延续了父权控制，又在新自由主义经济中将女性气质商品化。在数字语境中，算法对白手有形象的持续再生产，转化为外貌焦虑加剧、美容护肤产业投资激增，以及可接受美学范式不断收窄。身体由此成为持续劳动与改造的场域。

总而言之，白手游在中国数字文化中的兴起，展现了传统审美理想、全球消费文化与算法媒介的交汇融合。抖音、小红书等平台不仅映射这些审美标准，更通过界面默认设置与算法放大效应主动生产并规范化这些标准。本论文以白幼瘦理论框架为批判性文化视角，解析美颜滤镜的设计逻辑，揭示默认设置如何在日常数字生活中成为微妙而强大的性别规训工具。

Literature Review 
Chinese Digital Culture and the Bai Shou You (白瘦幼) Aesthetic
One of the most significant features of Chinese digital culture is the consolidation of bai shou you—literally “white, slim, young”—as a dominant feminine aesthetic ideal. This phrase, widely used in online discourse, captures three interrelated values: fairness of skin, slender body shape, and youthful or childlike appearance. While each of these ideals has a long cultural genealogy, their convergence into a singular shorthand term and their normalization through digital media platforms demonstrate how traditional beauty standards have been reshaped, intensified, and disseminated in the era of algorithmic media.
1. Historical and cultural roots The valorization of whiteness (bai) is deeply rooted in Chinese cultural history, where fair skin has long symbolized social class distinctions, leisure, and desirability. The proverb “一白遮百丑” (“fair skin conceals a hundred flaws”) epitomizes this enduring association. Slimness (shou), although historically less emphasized than in contemporary contexts, has increasingly become a marker of modern femininity in China, shaped by both global fashion industries and domestic discourses of health and self-discipline. Youthfulness (you), or more specifically the infantilized aesthetics of “少女感” (girlishness), reflects a cultural preference for purity, vulnerability, and idealized femininity. Taken together, bai shou you condenses these ideals into a powerful and easily communicable cultural formula.
2. Digital media amplification Chinese social media platforms, especially Douyin and Xiaohongshu, play a central role in amplifying and codifying the bai shou you ideal. On Xiaohongshu, lifestyle and beauty influencers frequently use hashtags such as “变白秘籍” (“whitening secrets”) or “减肥打卡” (“weight loss check-in”), reinforcing the pursuit of whiteness and slimness as everyday practices. Douyin’s viral “body challenges”—such as the A4 waist challenge, the collarbone coin challenge, or the iPhone leg challenge—visually gamify thinness, making body conformity a public performance. Studies have shown that exposure to these challenges correlates with heightened body dissatisfaction and appearance anxiety among young female users (Hu et al., 2023). Such practices illustrate how algorithmically driven trends foster a culture of self-surveillance and competition in relation to bai shou you.
3. Filter defaults and algorithmic normalization The prevalence of bai shou you is further entrenched by the design of beauty filters on these platforms. Default filters typically whiten skin, slim jawlines, enlarge eyes, and smooth textures, creating a homogenized “standard face” (标准脸). Filter names such as “初恋脸” (“first love face”), “妈生皮” (“born-with-it skin”), or “少女感” explicitly connect technical effects with cultural ideals of innocence, purity, and desirability. The fact that these effects are applied by default—often without user intervention—means that bai shou you is not only an aspirational standard but an algorithmically enforced baseline. The normalization of these effects reflects what Chun (2011) calls “habitual media”: technologies that train users’ desires and perceptions through repetition and default design.
4. Cross-cultural contrasts and localization While global platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat also promote homogenized beauty norms—often aligned with Eurocentric ideals like tanned skin, contoured cheekbones, and plump lips—the Chinese bai shou you aesthetic demonstrates a localized articulation of algorithmic beauty. As Xie and Zhang (2013) show in their cross-cultural study, Chinese advertisements overwhelmingly valorize pale skin, while U.S. ads tend to emphasize tanning and athleticism. Similarly, Meng (2025) documents how Chinese women abroad navigate conflicting expectations between bai shou you and Western ideals like the “Kardashian-style” curvaceous body. These comparisons highlight that while beauty filters globally discipline bodies, the specific ideals they enforce are culturally embedded and historically situated.
5. Social consequences and gender discipline The ubiquity of bai shou you has significant consequences for gender and self-presentation. Scholars such as Song Geng and Perry Link have argued that the regulation of female bodies in Chinese consumer culture is both a continuation of patriarchal control and a commodification of femininity in neoliberal economies. In digital contexts, the constant reproduction of bai shou you through algorithms translates into heightened appearance anxiety, increased investment in cosmetic and dermatological industries, and a narrowing of acceptable forms of beauty. The body becomes a site of continuous labor and modification, echoing Sandra Bartky’s concept of the “disciplinary practices” that produce docile feminine bodies. In this sense, Chinese digital culture demonstrates how the bai shou you aesthetic is not merely a preference but a disciplinary regime—one encoded and perpetuated by algorithmic aesthetics.

In summary, the rise of bai shou you in Chinese digital culture illustrates the convergence of traditional beauty ideals, global consumer culture, and algorithmic mediation. Platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu not only reflect these ideals but actively produce and normalize them through interface defaults and algorithmic amplification. For this dissertation, the bai shou you framework provides a critical cultural lens through which to interpret the design of beauty filters, demonstrating how defaults operate as subtle yet powerful tools of gender discipline in everyday digital life.
